Additionally, the dashboard masks granular sync failures, reporting success even when individual configs fail to stow.\n\nPlan:\n1. Fix State Corruption: Update setup.SaveState in internal/setup/setup.go to use state.Load() instead of state.New(), ensuring existing state is merged with the new InstallResult.\n2. Improve Sync Transparency: Update handleAction in cmd/g4d/interactive.go to inspect StowResult.Failed for ActionSync, ActionSyncConfig, and ActionBulkSync, reporting specific failures to the user.\n3. Unify Dashboard Status: Refactor internal/ui/dashboard/sidebar.go to unify getConfigStatusInfo, prioritizing granular LinkStatus over count-based DriftSummary.\n4. Verification: Add unit tests in internal/setup/setup_test.go to verify state merging.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"51134175+nvandessel@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-24T13:20:04.659560681-08:00","created_by":"Nic van Dessel","updated_at":"2026-01-24T14:13:40.440070366-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-24T14:13:40.440073913-08:00","labels":["bug","core","ui"]}
