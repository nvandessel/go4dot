Improve Sync Transparency: Update handleAction in cmd/g4d/interactive.go to inspect StowResult.Failed for ActionSync, ActionSyncConfig, and ActionBulkSync, reporting specific failures to the user.\n3.

{"id":"go4dot-vxi","title":"Investigate dashboard UI consolidation and lazygit-style layout","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nThe dashboard UI currently has several UX issues that break the unified experience:\n\n### Issues Identified\n\n1. **Tab menu not rendering** - When pressing tab, the menu view appears empty. The menu is created with 0 dimensions and WindowSizeMsg isn't forwarded properly when switching to viewMenu.\n\n2. **Operations take over entire screen** - `viewOperation` completely replaces the dashboard instead of showing operations in a panel/split. Users lose context of what they were looking at.\n\n3. **Many actions fall back to CLI output outside dashboard:**\n   - `ActionDoctor` → `doctorCmd.Run()` → CLI output + `waitForEnter()`\n   - `ActionMachineConfig` → `machine.RunInteractiveConfig()` → huh forms\n   - `ActionList` → `runMoreMenu()` → huh forms\n   - External menu → huh forms\n   - Uninstall → huh forms with CLI progress\n\n4. **Log visibility limited** - Only last 10 logs shown (`operations.go:211`), no scrolling, logs get lost during long operations.\n\n5. **No split-pane architecture** - Currently only header/summary/sidebar/details/footer. No dedicated output/log pane.\n\n### User Request\n\nMake the UI more like lazygit - dynamic, resizable, with dense information display that stays contained in one unified interface.\n\n### Potential Solutions to Investigate\n\n1. **Split pane for operations** - Add a third vertical pane (sidebar | details | output) or horizontal split (main content | log output at bottom)\n\n2. **Modal overlay** - Show operations in a modal with dashboard visible behind (semi-transparent or partial)\n\n3. **Inline operation status** - Show operation progress in the details pane or footer area without switching views\n\n4. **Scrollable log viewport** - Use bubbles/viewport component for scrollable log history\n\n5. **Unified component architecture** - Bring doctor, machine config, external, uninstall actions into dashboard components rather than falling back to CLI/huh forms\n\n### Reference\n\n- lazygit uses a consistent panel-based layout where different panes show different aspects (files, commits, branches, log)\n- Operations in lazygit happen with live output visible in a pane\n- Terminal resizing is handled gracefully\n\n### Files to Review\n\n- `internal/ui/dashboard/dashboard.go` - main model and view switching\n- `internal/ui/dashboard/operations.go` - current operation display (full-screen)\n- `internal/ui/dashboard/menu.go` - broken tab menu\n- `cmd/g4d/interactive.go` - handleAction falls back to CLI for many actions","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"51134175+nvandessel@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-27T08:22:17.518936699-08:00","created_by":"Nic van Dessel","updated_at":"2026-01-27T08:41:39.122509254-08:00","labels":["enhancement","ui"]}
